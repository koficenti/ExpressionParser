# ExpressionParser

Made with "Rust" using "Recursive Descent"

Last night (12/12/2023), I was programming in Elixir as one does but all the dynamic typing made me a little sick.

Nothing wrong with Elixir, just sometimes it requires more thought and oh well the error messages are pretty bad.

And so I made this in Rust real quick.

The following is the output of the test, works well enough.

Does in fact need some error handling so feel free to add that ðŸ˜‰

```
Assert (2 * 2) + (5) == 9
Assert 3 + 4 - 2 == 5
Assert 10 / 2 * 3 == 15
Assert (7 - 3) * 2 == 8
Assert 6 / (2 + 1) == 2
Assert (4 * 2) + (6 / 3) == 10
Assert 5 * (3 + 2) - 8 == 17
Assert (9 / 3) + (2 * 2) == 7
Assert (5 + 2) * (8 - 3) == 35
Assert 12 / 4 + (6 - 2) == 7
Assert 4 - 2 + 7 * 3 == 23
Assert 8 / 2 - 1 + 5 == 8
Assert (3 * 2) / (1 + 1) == 3
Assert (5 + 3) * (2 - 1) == 8
Assert 9 * 2 / (6 - 3) == 6
Assert 10 / (2 * 5) + 1 == 2
Assert 7 * (4 - 2) + 6 / 3 == 16
Assert (6 + 2) * (9 - 3) / 2 == 24
Assert (4 * 3) + 2 - 5 / 1 == 9
Assert 8 / 2 * (4 + 1) == 20
Wowz, it works
```


## Grammar
```
expr       -> term ( ('+' | '-') term )*
term       -> factor ( ('*' | '/') factor )*
factor     -> '(' expr ')' | NUMBER
NUMBER     -> [0-9]+
```

I think I used the right notation ðŸ¤”



## Thanks for checking my repo out!

Enjoy.
